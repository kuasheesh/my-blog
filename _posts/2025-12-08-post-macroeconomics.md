# The Algebraic AD–AS Model

### 1. The Aggregate Demand (AD) Curve
* **Definition:** The AD curve represents the level of output ($Y$) where the IS curve (goods market) and LM curve (asset market) intersect for any given price level ($P$).
* **Derivation:** Found by equating the interest rate ($r$) from the algebraic IS and LM equations and solving for $Y$.
* **The Equation:**
    $$
    Y = \frac{\alpha_{IS} - \alpha_{LM} + (1/\beta_{LM})(M/P)}{\beta_{IS} + \beta_{LM}}
    $$
    *(Note: This represents the intersection where output is a function of real money supply and market intercepts.)*
* **Key Characteristics:**
    * **Slope:** The curve slopes downward. As the price level ($P$) rises, real money supply ($M/P$) falls, reducing aggregate output demanded ($Y$).
    * **Shifts:**
        * **IS Shifts:** Expansionary fiscal policy (e.g., increased government purchases) shifts the IS curve up/right, shifting AD up/right.
        * **LM Shifts:** Expansionary monetary policy (increased nominal money supply, $M$) shifts the LM curve down/right, shifting AD up/right.

### 2. The Aggregate Supply Curves
* **Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS):**
    * Firms supply whatever output is demanded at a fixed price level.
    * **Equation:** Horizontal line where $P = P_{sr}$.
* **Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS):**
    * Output is fixed at the full-employment level, regardless of price.
    * **Equation:** Vertical line where $Y = \bar{Y}$.

### 3. Equilibrium Solutions
* **Short-Run Equilibrium:**
    * Occurs at the intersection of **AD** and **SRAS**.
    * **Calculation:** Substitute the fixed price ($P_{sr}$) into the AD equation to solve for output ($Y$).
* **Long-Run Equilibrium:**
    * Occurs at the intersection of **AD** and **LRAS** (where markets for labor, goods, and assets all clear).
    * **Output:** Fixed at $\bar{Y}$.
    * **Price Level:** The price level ($P$) is endogenous. It is found by setting the AD equation equal to $\bar{Y}$ and solving for $P$. This ensures the price level adjusts to align demand with full-employment output.
